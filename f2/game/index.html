                    <paragraph>The game that I am writting about is called Grand Theft Auto. This game is about three men who do all sorts of different misions to complete there part of the game. This game is a very violent game because it uses a lot of different types of wepons and the game alows you to kill people.
                            The characters in this game all come from different types of backgrounds. In this game you are alowed to operate all sorts of different vehicals and the vehicals that you are alowed to operate are pretty simular to the ones that you see in the world today. In this game you are alowed to
                            do many of the things that you are not alowd to do in the world today. If you are the type of person that likes to play games that relate to the world today than this game is the game that you should try out. This game also alows you to use millitary wepons and it also alows to use a lot
                            of the same vehicals that the military uses in the world today. The game dose have a police forces that do try to stop you when you do something bad. This game is not recomended to young children because it is way to violent and the things that are said in the game are not ment fot a young 
                            child to here. This game has many different types of versions of the game and they all have a lot of the same thing on it but the graphics are better in the newer ones and there are more things that you can do in the newer ones rather than the old ones. The plot line of this game takes place 
                            in LA California. This game is also about getting a bounch of money so that there are things that you can unlock with the money that you earn, there are a lot of different types of wepons that you can buy with the money that you earn, there are different upgrades that you can buy for your car
                            with the money that you earn. The way that you earn money in this game is by completing the different assignments that they give you, by picking up people in a taxi cab and taking them to where they need to go, by killing people, and many more. All of the different types of assignments that 
                             the game gives you most of them involve stealing things from other people in the game and most of them will git you in with the police of the game. The way that you can lose money in the game is if someone in the game kills you because you have to pay money to revive your self, another way 
                             that you can lose money is by buying things in the game. If you are the type of perso that likes games that have a lot of violence in the game than this is a game that I think that you should give a try. The character in this game have families that you have to protect in the game.
